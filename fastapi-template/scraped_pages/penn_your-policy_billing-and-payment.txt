Billing & Payment
Convenient payment options that fit your busy schedule.
Have peace of mind that your premium payment is on time by using our convenient pay online or phone options. Your payment is posted as paid on the same day you submit payment. Or, sign up for automatic payment from your checking account. All options are safe, secure and convenient.
Pay by Automatic Withdrawal
Save $$$ and pick your own due date.
When you sign up to have your payment automatically withdrawn from your bank account through our Recurring Payments Plan (RPP), our monthly RPP customers can pick their own due date and sign up for email reminders. Recurring Payments Plan is not applicable to Workers' Compensation policies on the PayGo plan.
It's easy. View our how-to video, then register or sign in to your account and complete the online form.
Pay Online
Whether you are using a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone, you can easily pay online with our mobile-ready website. Or better yet, download our mobile app for iPhone and Android for added convenience.

Please note that the use of unaffiliated third-party bill payment service providers, including those promoting themselves on the internet, may have risks. Timely payment of your premium is important and using an unaffiliated third-party bill payment service provider could impact the timeliness of your payment.

Everyone I spoke with was friendly, helpful, and reassuring.
