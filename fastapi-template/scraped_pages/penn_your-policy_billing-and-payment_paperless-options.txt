Paperless Options
In just one year, you would save six pounds of paper by switching to electronic billing.
Go green. In just one year, by switching from paper to electronic billing, statements and payments, the average American household would:
Save 6 pounds of paper
Save 23 pounds of wood
Create the greenhouse gas-reducing benefit of planting and growing one tree for five years
Prevent the production of 29 pounds of greenhouse gases, which is the equivalent of:
The emissions caused by driving 30 miles
The emissions caused by consuming 2 gallons of gasoline
We offer paperless options for billing and policy documents. In the Online Insurance Center (OIC), on the Account Overview page, click on Go Green to sign up.
Enjoy the freedom
Not only would you make a difference in your environmental footprint, think of the freedom you would enjoy:
Freedom from clutter—no more looking through stacks of mail to find your bill or policy
No stamps needed—no more hunting for stamps and making sure the envelope is mailed
Pay your bill anywhere, any time. Even if you are on vacation or away from home, you'll know when your bill is due and can pay online.
