Stand Against Racism
We Stand Against Racism
We are committed to making a positive difference.
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.   (Theme of sermon delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.)
Count on our unwavering voice among the chorus rejecting racism.
In our communities, and within our operations, Penn National Insurance is committed to making a positive difference.
