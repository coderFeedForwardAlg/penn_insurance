How reliable is your insurance company? A.M. Best Ratings help you assess the financial strength of your company.
Founded in 1899, A.M. Best Company is a full-service credit rating organization dedicated to serving the insurance industry. Policyholders refer to Best's ratings and analysis as a means of assessing the financial strength and creditworthiness of risk-bearing entities and investment vehicles.
In Oct. 2023, A.M. Best upgraded Penn National Insurance's Financial Strength Rating to A (Excellent) with a Stable Outlook. We are grateful to all of our team members, past and present, who contributed to this achievement. It is noteworthy to earn the coveted A rating in such turbulent times and in a period when downgrades are on the rise.
