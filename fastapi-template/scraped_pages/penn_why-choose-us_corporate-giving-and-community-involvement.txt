Community Support
We believe in making the world a better place. One way we do so is by supporting the communities we serve.
We focus much of our philanthropy on our headquarters city of Harrisburg, Pa., where we have given millions of dollars to our local, urban public school district, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to support other urban education-related initiatives. We rank among the largest contributors to our local United Way because we match employee donations dollar for dollar.
Along with financial support, we give our time by encouraging employees to volunteer through workplace opportunities and time off to volunteer. Also, we offer several programs that provide honorary contributions to organizations served by our employees.
