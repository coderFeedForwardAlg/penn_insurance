Corporate Responsibility
Our commitment to positively impact the environment and society and to sustain our world.
Penn National Insurance was founded for the singular purpose of providing security and service to its policyholders. A century later, our mutual structure continues to provide a perfect alignment of interests between the company and our policyholders. Unlike companies with shareholder obligations, we have the ability to take the long-term view that allows us to completely focus on doing what is right for our policyholders.
With this long-term outlook, we are also able to provide a healthy and stable work environment for our team members, foster relationships with business partners and support the communities where we work and live.
Like all insurance companies, our core activities naturally support sustainability by:
Providing loss control services to policyholders to minimize their risk
Supporting strong building codes to protect assets and the environment
Promoting safe driving habits to protect individuals and society
Serving as a risk transfer mechanism for economic activity
OurÂ Corporate Responsibility Report is intended to help inform our stakeholders about our efforts to positively impact the environment and society and to sustain our world.
Could not be more pleased with your services!
