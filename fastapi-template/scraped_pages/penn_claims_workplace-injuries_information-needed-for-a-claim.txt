Information Needed to Report A Claim
We are happy to fill out the proper forms needed and submit the claim.
Calling our Workers' Compensation claims customer service number is the fastest and easiest way to file a claim.
Experienced staff are ready to complete the necessary form for you or your policyholder and file it electronically. Plus, we'll make sure that the form is sent to all required recipients: NCIC, the agency, employer, employee and KeyScripts.
Another important benefit is that you immediately obtain a claim number, which is needed by medical offices when an employee receives treatment. Not having a claim number could delay medical treatment for the employee.
When you call our workers’ compensation claims customer service number, make sure that you have as much of the following information as possible. While this information is not needed to initiate a claim, we will ask you for this information at some point so we can better manage the claim.
