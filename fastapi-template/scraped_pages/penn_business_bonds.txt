We minimize the time it takes to get a bond approved.
We strive to understand your business and your bond needs, which is what separates us from the competition. Our bonds are produced exclusively through independent agents. Our veteran underwriters work with your agent to truly comprehend your business plan and your financial condition to reach a mutually beneficial line of credit.
Our underwriters combine the experience of a large surety with the flat underwriting structure of a small company, which gets you intelligent answers quickly.
Penn National Insurance offers a full range of surety and fidelity bond products in most states.
