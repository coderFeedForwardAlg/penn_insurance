Property Inventory
A Personal Property Inventory is invaluable in case of a loss.
An inventory of your personal property will prove invaluable in case of fire, theft or other damage to your home. When you have completed the inventory, give a copy to your Penn National Insurance agent to keep with your file, and keep a copy in your safe deposit box or in another off-site fireproof location. In addition to a written inventory, you may want to take a photographic or video inventory.
Tips for taking inventory
Set aside several hours to complete your inventory
Go through each room methodically
Take photos or video of each room to keep with your inventory
Record the make and model, serial numbers, brand and manufacturer’s information where applicable
Make specific notes of the value of especially valuable items
Keep receipts with the inventory filed in an off-site, fireproof location
Don’t forget closets, attic, basement and garages
Appraisals of collections, jewelry, antiques and other valuables are very important. Keep copies of appraisals with your inventory form. Have your appraisals updated every several years.
Update your inventory each time you make a significant purchase
I've never had an insurance claim but when I needed assistance with some hail damage Penn National Insurance came through and very promptly helped me get the damage taken care of.
