Does your business insurance earn dividends?
In today’s economic market, it is good to have stability in an insurance partner. We partner with local chambers and associations to bring their members group-buying power, product and pricing incentives, and the possibility to earn a dividend. Dividends often pay for the cost of membership and then some.
An important aspect of our group insurance programs is preventing loss and controlling claims costs. Because dividends are based on the group’s collective loss experience, a business that may have had a significant loss may still be eligible to receive a dividend. Penn National Insurance has paid millions in dividends.
For more information, contact your Penn National Insurance agent.
Groff’s Home Comfort Team received a check for being in the Members Advantage Program through the Chamber and Penn National Insurance and we couldn't be more pleased. This dividend is significantly going to help our bottom line.
