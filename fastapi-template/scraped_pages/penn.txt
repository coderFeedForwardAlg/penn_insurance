What Our Customers Are Saying About Penn National Insurance
I recently had my very first commercial building claim with Penn National, and I couldn't be more impressed with how everything was handled. From the very beginning the process was smooth and professional.
... in customer service went above and beyond--she was thorough, courteous, and always willing to answer my questions with patience. The adjuster assigned to my claim showed the same level of professionalim, carefully reviewing every detail and keeping me updated every step of the way. Both of them made what could have been a stressful and overwhelming experience surprisingly easy to navigate.

What stood out most to me was the communication. I never felt left in the dark, and I always knew what to expect next. That level of care builds real confidence in an insurance provider, and it's something I truly value.
Overall, Penn National turned what I thought would be a difficult situation into a very positive experience. If you're looking for an insurance company that's responsive, professional, and genuinely committed to its customers, I highly recommend Penn National.

I had a condensation pan on the furnace over flow that over time caused the dry wall to saturate and fall down. Also, the mineral wool insulation is blown in and there was a real mess.
We didn't know of the problem because we just bought the house last year.
The two Penn National adjusters were very professional. An adjuster was there in two days and the claim was settled with a payment check within the week. The confidence to look for a contrator is great.

First claim in with this carrier on 7 years and no hassle. It was resolved fast and paid quick. I was reluctant to file a claim as to not have my rates go up but when my 30 foot long garage door was backed into I had no choice. They resolved it quick and sent a check out right away.

I woke up to a leak in the wall of my upstairs bathroom. The water was coming out of the 1st floor light fixtures. It flooded both floors. I ran outside and shut the water off then called my insurance co. She opened a claim for me.
I called my contractor to start remediation immediately. The adjuster sent an appraiser out. I had a check within weeks that covered EVERYTHING!! So happy with the outcome. Thank you PENN NATIONAL!
