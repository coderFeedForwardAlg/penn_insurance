Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) links are for the convenience of our policyholders and clients. Under certain circumstances, policyholders and clients who file informational tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service must obtain the taxpayer identification number of the party to whom they make payment, as well as certify that a payment recipient is not subject to backup withholding of taxes from any such payment. This is typically accomplished by obtaining a completed W-9 form from a payee. Click on a company link below to view a completed W-9 form for that company.
